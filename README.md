# DFS-Depth-First-Search-
"This code implements the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for traversing or searching graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, using recursion or a stack. Suitable for tasks like connected components, topological sorting, and cycle detection."
